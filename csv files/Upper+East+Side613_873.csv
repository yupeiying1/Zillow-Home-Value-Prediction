The three-sided bay is elegantly accentuated by classical details. Although removed years ago, the door was originally was located on the parlour floor and reached by a high stoop. Today, exterior mahogany doors are flanked by two freestanding Ionic columns, which support a blank entablature that now serves as a sill to the parlour floor transomed casement window above.

These three classic rooms may elegantly entertain 150 people for cocktails, with the dining room alone seating 48. Major dignitaries, institutional leaders, significant sports figures and corporate scions have all been honored in these spaces. 

 

	The appealing, wainscoted eat-in kitchen houses a new 800-pound Pro 48 Sub-Zero refrigerator, Viking grill-stove, Miele dishwasher, convection oven, washer/dryer, and a marble-topped family dining table. Pet-friendly details abound, with a built-in sheltered and festooned private pet space and a street-viewing observation stair deck, for full-time pet amusement. A brass-balustraded staircase from the kitchen leads to a middle floor featuring two studies or bedrooms, and a junior squash court/gymnasium which could easily be converted into a home theater or art studio. Additionally, just down the hall there is a wet pantry and a half bath. This layout offers an oasis from the activity of the main floor above, allowing for an effective and productive home office. 



	The bottom floor contains a small but complete independent apartment including a bookshelf-filled bedroom, Clive Christianson kitchen, and a full brick-walled Soho bathroom. This self-contained enclave with a door leading directly to the street has housed many a summer tutor, staff member and itinerant family member and/or friend. 



	The flowing and vast flexible spaces offer something for everyone, be it grand entertaining space for a Julliard piano concerto, or quiet leeway for reflection and creativity. The floor-by-floor independent egress, particularly the middle floor door to the lobby allows for easy street access on a rainy dog-walking night, or a snowy boot-stomping repository. Technologically, the three levels are integrally connected with recent CAT wiring and FIOS, allowing for a unified audio, Wi-Fi, cable and phone/intercom system. There are four separate AC zones, with the bottom floor condenser located in a coveted sidewalk cave. The entity encompasses two legally-separable spaces. 



	The current owners have lovingly crafted every corner and every shelf with a purpose: be it glass rows for seasonal Hermes scarves in the master bedroom, monkey bars in the pantry or lit glass shoe shelves in the second bedroom for Prada platform pumps. Interestingly, the current owners are only the second occupants of the space as the builder, Rouse & Goldstone, gave this prized escape to his daughter upon the building's completion in 1914. Many original, historic Golden Era details remain, including beseeching cove ceilings, paneled frame-molded walls, elegant French doors, crystal doorknobs and stunning architectural crown moldings throughout.



This unique space is so extensive and flexible that feels like a country home in the City with Central Park just two blocks away, yet offering the cultural significance of a quick jaunt to the Met. This extraordinary layout at 850 Park allows the new owner to engage in an adventure to be successfully navigated with joy, entertainment and fulfillment."
