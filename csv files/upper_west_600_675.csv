Wake up to sweeping Central Park and skyline vistas every day! 444 Central Park West 8A is a beautifully-maintained three-bed, two-and-a-half bath with four exposures and gorgeous park views from every bedroom (and even two of the bathrooms), as well as from its gracious living room. 

High beamed ceilings, lovingly-cared-for hardwood flooring and elegant molding frame every room, lending the apartment a classical continuity. This warm, inviting Upper West Side home is full of luxurious touches in an eminently livable layout-all for under $3 million. 

The beautiful, comfortable sleeping quarters provide privacy from the living and dining areas, both of which offer lovely entertaining spaces.

Lit by three oversized windows that open the apartment to the park and city, the airy master suite is bathed in sun from dual Southern and Eastern exposures. Daybreak and twilight views in this room are not to be missed! The bedroom has a walk-in closet and comes outfitted with custom built-in shelving and drawers along the Southern wall. A windowed, mint-condition full bathroom with dual sinks, marble tiles and countertop and park views completes the suite. 

The second and third bedrooms are large and luxe, both with Southern exposures looking out over Central Park and the Manhattan skyline. The bright second bedroom has custom shelving and cabinetry encircling the large triple-paned window, along with an adjustable built-in workspace along the opposite wall; the giant third bedroom can hold multiple beds and has dual windows with a continuous built-in window seat. Both bedrooms have generous closet space, with the third bedroom offering the apartment's second walk-in closet. The mint-condition Jack-and-Jill bathroom is only accessible from the bedrooms, rather than from the common space-ideal for privacy. This full bathroom's large window also has park and city views. Although the property is listed as a three-bedroom apartment, both the second and third bedrooms can function as rec rooms, offices and more depending on owners' needs. 

Down the hall from the bedrooms, the gleaming herringbone floors of the entry foyer and central gallery greet you. The stately gallery can easily accommodate a large armoire and credenza, and both the foyer and gallery have coat closets for more storage. A renovated half bathroom for guests sits just off the gallery-this additional bathroom is a feature unique to this unit, added during renovations and not found in comparable listings in the building. 

The gallery opens into a substantial living room, which, at nearly 375sf, provides tremendous flexibility . The current layout easily fits 2 couches, 2 armchairs, an armoire and a piano. Move in and design big! The three-paned, unobstructed East-facing window provides beautiful natural light throughout the day as well as unobstructed and seasonally-changing views of Central Park: the tender buds of spring, deep green leaves of summer, bright autumn foliage and the Triboro bridge through the bare branches of winter.

If you want to share the view with guests, the flow of the living room, gallery and dining room are perfect for gracious entertaining. The enormous dining room can accommodate a table for 10 with space to spare. An interior window opens the kitchen to the dining area, but comes with blinds that can be shut if cooking gets too noisy. Polished granite countertops, a Miele dishwasher, Viking range, Subzero refrigerator and Bosch washer/dryer make this pristine, windowed kitchen into a chef-level workspace. The kitchen also has a service entrance. 

444 Central Park West is a well-run, pet-friendly pre-war co-op designed in 1929 by famed architects Boak & Paris. The building keeps full-time doormen and a live-in super on staff and offers elevators, private storage and a bike room for residents. Art Deco ornamentation gives the 19-story building a handsome, historic gravitas. It sits on the northwest corner of 104th St and Central Park West only a block from the 103rd Street B and C subways and a few short blocks from the 96th St A/B/C and 1/2/3 lines, making getting up and down Manhattan simple."
