Extraordinary light and scale abound in this converted West Chelsea Arts District warehouse, featuring column-free exposed brick living and entertainment space that expands over 6,400 square feet. With both a ground and parlor level entrance, 536 West 29th Street is configured perfectly and is move-in ready for an art foundation, artist, gallerist or collector. Awe-inspiring ceiling heights range over 30' and showcase original, exposed wooden beams from the building's days as a production and art studio for Broadway sets. Meticulously restored and tastefully modernized, the residence flows through multiple airy levels with interlocking double and triple height ceiling heights, accessible through a series of stairs and a footway bridge. The zoning, as well as an additional SF of buildable air rights, allows for a further expansion of this dramatically proportioned home.
 
One enters the property via an unassuming stoop off 29th street and walks into a central atrium featuring 32' ceilings, from which there are two gracious bedrooms with en suite full baths. The jaw-dropping great room in turn is accessed via stairs inspired by Adirondack bridges and chairs, made with a custom steel frame, thick rustic cedar boards, timbers and rustic rails. The double height room impresses with 20' ceilings and has a loft like open-concept kitchen, dining and living area with cabinetry custom designed from California redwood, salvaged Cabernet Sauvignon wine barrels. The same California redwood staves accent the den and other areas on the first floor and provide beautiful contrast to other custom walnut, mahogany, pine and cedar carpentry throughout. 

Light pours in throughout the property from a wall of windows on the south faade, multiple copper and original steel skylights, and an oversized arched window on the north face of the building. Through the great room and just off the kitchen, an oversized Japanese white glass terrace overlooks a 750 SF garden, which provides a sanctuary from the city outside with its 22' tall Cor-Ten steel walls topped with custom copper flashing. Original Dutch ballast cobblestones form garden pathways that bifurcate an amalgam of rich organic soil where all manner of landscaping has thrived. Back inside, a glass bridge with custom designed rustic cedar railing leads to a sunken den area, and above, a cozy library featuring hand milled Hudson Valley walnut, which provides a perfect viewing deck overlooking the great room.

The ground floor is presently designed as a single floor studio space with 19' ceilings and includes a 6' x 18' design table with a custom oak platform. The floors are custom indigo pigmented concrete and the double entry doors are old growth Douglas fir of the California Arts and Crafts School style, featuring the original P. E. Guerin hardware. There are gas, electric, and water connections at the rear of the showroom to add a kitchen, as well as water connections at the entrance for a full bath. At the rear of the studio is an open stairway leading up to the main house and the private garden.

West Chelsea is at the center of an expanding Hudson River/Downtown Manhattan development boom. This area alone has seen a multi-billion dollar infrastructure and expansion with incoming luxury high end residential developments, boutique hotels and restaurants, and the evolving Hudson Yards project flanking the world-renowned art gallery district and iconic High Line Park. Within all of this, 536 West 29th Street stands out as a tribute to old New Yorkeven the property's stone stoop and curb are the original New York bluestone.

Boasting twenty feet of width, it contains an owner's duplex with three gracious bedrooms and an amazing rear garden. The third and fourth stories host floor-through, free-market apartments. They are well-appointed and delightfully sunny. 

During a 2017 renovation, the front faade and roof were replaced, and an extension was added to the parlour and garden floors. The owner's duplex was also completely refreshed with an open layout, new kitchen, and industrial architectural elements.

448 West 25th Street is rife with opportunity for those interested in living with income or single-family. There is potential to add more square footage onto the rear of the townhouse, and the price range is unbeatable for such a prime location. 

Garden Floor:
A major highlight of the townhouse is the spectacular garden. It's a city oasis with a high privacy fence, two blooming trees, manicured flower beds, and stone surface. When it's finally time to come inside, a private staircase leads down into the sunken master bedroom of the owner's duplex.

Double doors open from the master bedroom to reveal the heart of the garden floor and showcase a restored stone wall and industrial-style staircase. Across from the stairs is a cozy den or home office, which is set-apart by a wall of glass and features a working fireplace and more custom shelving.

A long hallway containing five built-in closets leads past a laundry room and full bathroom, complete with double vanity and large walk-in shower. A third, nicely-sized bedroom is situated at the front of the garden floor. There is a discrete door within the room that leads to the townhouse's mechanicals, as well as a door that provides access to the street under the stoop. 

Parlour Floor:
A tidy vestibule welcomes all residents home, and allows them to part ways either up the stairs to two apartments or into the owner's duplex. Once inside, the parlour floor embraces an open concept and creates the opportunity for every room to have a view of the rear garden. The front of the floor has two large windows and can be used as a bedroom or home office. It is separated from the kitchen by a glass wall. The kitchen itself makes an efficient use of space and features ceiling-height custom cabinets, a hidden pantry, a black granite countertop, and high-end appliances including a SubZero, gas range, and dishwasher.
