Head west into Tribeca, north into Soho, east towards the Seaport and south towards the heart of the Financial District.



Built in 1886, The Potter Building's elaborate red brick and terra cotta facade is a fusion of Queen Anne, Neo-Grec, Renaissance Revival, and Colonial Revival motifs. At 11 stories high, it is one of New York's most significant surviving tall office buildings of the period prior to the development of the skyscraper. It stands as a testament to the most advanced fireproofing methods then available. The building was once part of New York's celebrated Newspaper Row and housed the editorial office of the New York Observer. It was converted to residential co-ops in 1980 and designated a New York City Landmark in 1996.



The building's lobby was updated in 2010, new elevators installed in 2012, the windows were replaced in 2015, and the hallways were just recently handsomely renovated. There's a lovely planted common roof deck and pets are welcome.
