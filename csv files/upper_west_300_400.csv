Beyond a bespoke dwelling, the person bold enough to write the next chapter in this significant property's history, obtains a priceless piece of New York City's architectural heritage as well. - In a prime location on West End Avenue & West 82nd Street, this landmarked building has been meticulously researched to restore McKim, Mead & White's original vision for its exterior and offers every possible modern luxury: multiple bedrooms with ensuite baths + powder rooms, an endless swimming pool, theatre, library, stone fireplaces, game room, roof deck, and garden. The site can be built up to an estimated 8,500 SF maximum. It is within walking distance to both Riverside and Central Parks. - The property is offered ""as is"", delivered completely vacant, with first phase design plans for redevelopment. It was damaged by a fire in late 2013, but the existing structure is quite salvageable. The property lies within the Riverside-West End Historic District and is zoned R-10A. The extra-wide lot measures 24' x 100', and the existing 5 story building is 24' x 70' and 7200 SF. Plans are subject to the approval of the NYC LPC & DOB. Next phase design and construction are required at additional cost."

Just steps from Riverside Park, this elegant 20-foot wide brownstone, on quiet, tree-lined West 77th Street, is an opportunity of endless potential. The townhouse will be delivered vacant and include plans conceived by renowned architectural firm The Turett Collaborative. With completed approvals from both the NYC DOB and NYC Landmarks Preservation Commission, a buyer has the immediate ability to transform this edifice into a six story, 7,825 sf, single family masterpiece of modern design and sophisticated style. With 6 bedrooms, 8 full baths, 2 half baths, 1,225 sf of outdoor space and an elevator which services all floors, this is a rare opportunity to create your own custom dream home and save substantial time in planning and approvals.  



The existing Renaissance Revival front facade will be complemented with a new stoop and new clay tiled mansard roof in order to return the facade to its former and original glory. By contrast, the rear of the home will receive a completely new facade and addition rendered in custom handmade Danish Kolumba brick punctuated by deep set and delicately mullioned high performance German windows.  



Married and integral to the new rear facade is a rooftop addition clad in contemporary Danish clay roof tiles and zinc cassette panels. Ipe wood decking surrounding the hot tub, Oko skin fencing, and landscaped planters introduce warmth and scale to the rooftop with unobstructed views to the west and south. The outdoor kitchen and terraced nature of the roof deck provides a myriad of opportunities for social interaction or can alternately be a peaceful place for quiet contemplation.



Outdoor space is not limited to the rooftop alone. A private 4'-0"" wide x 14'-0"" long terrace is carved out of the sloped clay roof tile at the new rear facade, providing a discrete outdoor space for the 4th floor rear bedroom. The projection of the new addition into the rear yard creates the opportunity for an 8'-0"" wide x 18'-0"" long landscaped terrace immediately off of the 3rd floor rear bedroom with a built in structural skylight to allow additional light into the master bathroom suite beneath. The graciously proportioned terrace has prominent views into the rear yard garden space below, that is itself complete with its own outdoor kitchen and dining area on the lower level with a lawn encircled by lush trees and plantings on the upper level. Planters and steps hovering over a built in water feature define the separation between the two garden elevations, allowing one to feel entirely removed and at one with the nature that surrounds. Both south facing yard levels bring copious amounts of light into the cellar below with the use of structural skylights integrated with the surrounding lawn and pavers.



The remarkably long depth of the building allows for a conventional centrally located stair and elevator core to be supplemented by architectural features which infuse the plan with richness and detail. For example, a rather classical parlor level living room featuring a built-in Ortal gas fueled fireplace, connects via a butler's pantry to a dramatic glass and steel walled dining room, also with its own built-in Ortal fireplace and custom millwork, which opens out over a 20'-0"" high double height great room below with views of the garden beyond.  



Generous full width bedrooms face the front and rear with ample room for closets, luxuriously appointed ensuite bathrooms with Arne Jacobsen designed Vola fixtures, Ann Sacks savoy tiles, and Henrybuilt vanities. Other modern home conveniences such as cellar to roof elevator access, multiple laundry locations, as well as a light-filled playroom with wet bar at the top floor, continue to display the countless amenities of this state of the art home. 



The second floor alone is dedicated to the master suite that includes a large 16'-0"" wide x 18'-0"" long bedroom complete with a gentle curving bay window and fireplace, 10'-0"" wide x 18'-0"" long walk-in closet, a private study with wet bar, a separate bathroom clad in Nero Marquina marble, and an 11'-0"" wide x 19'-0"" long master bathroom clad in Calacatta Vision marble slabs with chevron floor pattern. One could easily imagine the tranquility of relaxing in the Teuco free-standing bathtub watching the sunset from the views out to the bathroom's picture windows or immersing in the Calacatta Vision clad steam shower with Dornbracht control spa fixtures. 



The cellar, which proposes to be excavated and extended below the rear garden, provides ample space for a recreation room with wet bar, a private home gym, and a climate controlled glass walled wine cellar. It features its own spa with Montauk Gray slate floors and waxed Venetian plaster walls complete with a custom sauna and steam shower.



At the center of the home is the garden level kitchen handsomely appointed with Gaggenau appliances. The rich walnut faced cabinets by Henrybuilt are accentuated and livened by brushed brass hardware and both work in concert with the opulent Calacatta Vision marble countertop slabs and backsplash. Wide plank white oak floors tie the whole palette together both at the kitchen and throughout the house.  Immediately adjacent to the kitchen is a 17'-0"" wide x 20'-0"" deep great room with room for both informal dining and living which will truly be the heart of the home. It is here where the handmade Danish Kolumba brick from the exterior facade enters the interior, cladding the walls of the great room's signature double height space and its eastern elevation which features a blackened steel, walnut, and glass walled fireplace insert carved into the brick.  



When preparing a meal in the kitchen or informally lounging in front of the fireplace, it would be impossible to ignore the views from the double height glass wall towards the tiered garden beyond. The glass wall itself features a 10'-0"" wide metal and glass pivoting door, which at the touch of a button allows the great room to be completely open to the garden, bringing the outdoors in and the indoors out. 



This artfully crafted residence is the perfect home for someone with a keen appreciation for design and a desire to live in a modern sanctuary amidst the vibrant city that surrounds."
