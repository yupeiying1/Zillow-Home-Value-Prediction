Aristotle Onassis and his first wife Tina enjoyed sitting on this terrace and watching boats go by at eye level. John Whitehead lived here for the last 26 years of his life, describing the house and private park overlooking the East River as ""a joyous retreat not found anywhere else in this city.""



Rebuilt brick by brick in the mid 1940s, the house was totally renovated in 1986. Third floor master bedroom has sweeping river views all the way to the Brooklyn Bridge. The fourth floor has two ensuite double bedrooms and the roof allows for the possibility of building two more; all overlooking the river. A brand new, large main kitchen is in the aboveground basement. Adjacent are two maids rooms (presently combined) and a bath, making this a complete suite for help, with floor exits on to the only private backyard in this complex (could accommodate a swing set for young children and/or other equipment). Additional, smaller but full kitchen on the first floor. 



This house is like nothing you will ever see in NYC. The glass circular staircase virtually cantilevers over the river, and feels as if on the deck of an elegant yacht.   Enormous enclosed garden, right on the river, is shared with 13 other townhouses. Sunny views of the water on three sides of every floor are blindingly beautiful! And by night the 59th Street Bridge lights up and casts a playful reflection on the water, creating a magical view from the house."

Apartment 61L in the upper reaches of Trump Tower has just been listed. The 2,510 sq. ft. L apartment, the finest three bedroom, three and one-half bath apartment of the building only existed from the 55th Floor to the 63rd Floor, and many of those have now been combined with other apartments so to have an L come available at this high level is a true rarity.


Situated on the 61st floor this apartment affords spectacular panoramic views of Central Park to the north, sweeping west to the Hudson River and then south to feature views of Manhattan's most iconic buildings, including the Empire State Building, The Chrysler Building and The Freedom Tower. With the backdrop of stunning views in every room, this magnificently renovated apartment is at once light, open and airy but quietly underscored by the elegance and richness of the highest quality marble, stone and wood finishes interpreted by the finest craftsmen. Floating high above Central Park and the City, the setting is without compare. 


As you enter the understated foyer you are drawn forward into the subtly detailed grand corner living and entertaining space comprised of a large gallery, the living and dining room with three breathtaking exposures complimented by a wet bar with glass and enclosed cabinetry, and an open chef's kitchen with top-of-the line appliances which provides for warm, comfortable entertaining in the most elegant of settings. The kitchen includes a large pantry area with custom storage and a washer/dryer. A sumptuous powder room is discreetly positioned off of the gallery.

Immediately adjacent to the living room and open off of the gallery through double doors is a corner den/office/bedroom with spectacular City views to the south and west. This room can be appointed to further enhance and compliment the living/entertaining area of the apartment or can be privatized to create a third bedroom. From the gallery, moving north into the bedroom wing, there is a beautifully rendered bedroom with amazing views of Central Park, generous closet space and its own luxurious bath with a shower overlooking Central Park!

Proceeding into the master bedroom suite, you enter a haven of privacy and refinement with one wall of artfully customized cabinetry to accommodate a television, books and treasures. It is opposite a long wall with a king-sized bed overlooking Central Park and generous bedside tables. In front of the large picture window overlooking Central Park is a restful seating area. Just off of the master chamber is a magnificent dressing room lined with custom 
cabinetry of the highest quality which leads into the very private bathroom with a large soaking tub, stall shower, double sink and private water closet, all appointed in keeping with this most magnificent setting."
