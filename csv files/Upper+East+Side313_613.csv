Grand Space and Architecture-Historically Significant - Beautiful Design on Fifth



A majestic residence occupying the entire fourth floor of one of Manhattan's most prestigious limestone prewar cooperatives,1020 Fifth Avenue, this historic residence bespeaks timeless design. Expansive views overlooking the Metropolitan Museum of Art set the stage for this gracious residence. There is tremendous energy in its sunlit, distinguished 56' of frontage along Museum Mile.



True to the original details of the initial Beaux-Arts architecture imagined by Whitney Warren and Charles D. Wetmore. Original details and moldings remain, transporting you to Paris, where the renowned architects mastered the Classic and French styles which were the preferred modes of expression during the early 20th Century. Grand spaces, hand-crafted ceilings and wood burning fireplaces set the tone for this uniquely beautiful home.



You are first welcomed into your own private elevator entrance which opens into a 16' X 11'-foot central gallery with 11' 8"" ceilings enhancing the magnitude and luxurious volume of this home. Beckoning you to enter from the generous gallery is the grand living room with dramatic direct views of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The distinction of this commanding room is that it is designed to accommodate you and many guests or to make you feel comfortable if you are enjoying time home alone.



Adjacent to the living room or entered from the central gallery is your enormous formal dining room. Decorative frescoed Venetian plaster finishes and hand painted ceilings to reflect the chandelier capture an exquisite allegiance to detail. In addition to north-eastern windows, another wood burning fireplace instills a feeling of comfort, security and affable living. 



The significance of the past and the promise of the future, inspired by the proximity to the museum echoes throughout this home. Contemplation is invited in your private study that is conjoined to a 16' x 19' library overlooking the Museum's iconic steps you with south and west facing windows drawing one's eyes south to Central Park. Another grand wood burning fireplace entices you to sit and enjoy the company of good books or good friends. 



Conveniently adjoined is your oversized, airy kitchen that appropriately leads to a large staff room with its private bath and the apartment's laundry beyond. Your courtly lifestyle with options for grand or low-keyed entertainment can be run smoothly and discreetly from behind the scenes. 



The intrinsic character of Warren & Wetmore's residential commissions is palpable in the four private salons with their en-suite baths in the southern and eastern facing rooms that are located in the remainder of your private floor. With four bedrooms plus study, plus library , four wood burning fireplaces , a staff room and private laundry and high ceilings throughout one is tempted to discuss cubic instead of square footage. The architects were devoted to Beaux-Arts principles which include the allocation of large spaces that allow for privacy as well as for coming together to enjoy life. 



Warren and Wetmore's core principle of creating buildings that fused architecture and sculpture are never more evident than in this property at 1020 Fifth Avenue. This home is one for the ages. Call to schedule an appointment."

The foyer leads up to a formal gallery hall on the parlour floor. Complete with soaring ceiling, grand ""L? staircase that wraps around, and multiple closets, the gallery is ideal for greeting guests and letting the bustle of the city fade away. The parlour front hosts a formal living room with three tall windows that stream in sunlight as well as a beautiful fireplace with original marble hearth. 

The rear of the parlour floor is a formal dining room with handsome wall paneling and a bay with double-height windows. There is also a dramatically tall fireplace in this room. Beyond the dining room lies a uniquely configured kitchen that takes advantage of the long extension on the townhouse. There are multiple windows, a pantry with long counters, and a cooking area that professional or home chefs would enjoy. A powder room is also found on the parlour floor. 

Third Floor:
The third floor is dedicated to two bedroom suites. The front hosts a sunny master bedroom with fireplace, ample closet space, and an ensuite full bathroom. Another sizeable bedroom with an adjacent sitting room or nursery occupies the third floor rear. Boasting multiple windows overlooking the garden, original mantelpiece, and half-bathroom, this suite is one-of-a-kind. As an added bonus, a classic wet bar is situated in the hallway between the bedrooms.
