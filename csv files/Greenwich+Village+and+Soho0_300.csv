Chevron floors continue from the living spaces, while full-height windows invite ample light and a sense of spaciousness. Adjacent to the oversized walk-in closet, the master bathroom is a study in luxury. The tonal depth of honed Grigio Dove stone balances the cerused oak veneer paneling of Korban's custom double vanity, surrounded by reflective layers of mirror and glass that create space and magnify light. Chevron-patterned tiling in Calacatta moonlight statuary marble, Lefroy Brooks Kafka collection polished chrome fixtures, and reveals in the ceiling coves complete the dynamic and elevated ensemble. The secondary bedroom features an en suite bath, exquisitely appointed in Korban's meticulous symphony of edited yet expressive materials, textures, and tones. A discreet laundry room features a sleek, side-by-side LG Washer and Dryer for unparalleled convenience, completing this exceptional residence.

A mixed use coop (residential and office), it a classic loft building, having converted in the 1970s. Unique to its conversion was the developer's plan to only convert the 5th floor and higher as residences. Lower floors remained small offices for artists and others. That tradition still exists today. Solidly built, it is a beautiful building on the outside. Shaped like a U it's apartments separate between the North and South Side, with exposures on Hudson, Franklin and the interior of the U. Window design vary by floor.
