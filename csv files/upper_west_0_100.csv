The sale of the reimagined Kleeberg Residence, an individual New York City landmark, offers a once in a lifetime opportunity to purchase one of the largest and widest single-family residences ever offered in Manhattan. 3 Riverside Drive boasts 26 principal rooms across a gross interior square footage of 18,052 square feet with approved plans for 9 bedrooms, 11 bathrooms, 4 half bathrooms, two studies, a staff office, an 83 ft/25 meter marble pool, a partial basketball court, a stadium seating movie theatre and endless other amenities. The house is 37 ft wide, has a soaring 25 ft high double height oval living room and is directly on Riverside Park with sunset views over the park and the Hudson River with tremendous natural light. 



Originally designed by famed mansion architect CPH Gilbert in the late 19th century, the home will be delivered to the new purchaser with fully approved Landmarks & DOB plans by the acclaimed Italian superyacht architect Achille Salvagni. Salvagni is an AD collector top 100 international designer, a member of Elle Décor's A-List, won Robb Reports 2018 Best of the Best Yacht Interior Designer, won the World Yachts Trophies Award and his custom furniture routinely sells at auction and in premier galleries around the world.



Construction has been for the past 18 months and much has been accomplished: more than half of 36 ft of excavation through bedrock is complete, the interior is fully demolished, 3/4ths of the required shoring is complete, and approvals and all permits are issued and approved. The new owner can complete the current project in a seamless manner or has the option to customize to their own liking. 



Current approved plans deliver only the highest level of luxury amenities and finish to the home. Approved amenities more typically found in a large, full-service building include a half Olympic sized lap pool (25 meters), an onyx-walled hot tub, a 22 ft high basketball court, a stadium-style cinema, multiple terraces including a panoramic rooftop terrace, radiant heating throughout, a side-walk and stoop snow and ice melting system, a generator, bullet proof windows on the lower front of the house, a full security and building management system and laundry/trash chutes throughout the home. 



The residence is marked by its unparalleled scale and unique footprint, with fully expressed width at 37 ft and depth built to the full extent of the lot on the ground floor and most of the lot up to the roof. This provides tremendous scale to the home including a master suite spanning 2,200 square feet with large and separate his and her bathrooms and closets and a powder room. The her closet is two stories with its own interior stair-case and spans nearly 1000 square feet. Ceiling height throughout the house ranges from 10-25 ft. The park-front positioning of the home as well as rarely found windows on the 2nd-5th floors in the middle room of the floor allow for all day light and views of the Hudson River, exceedingly rare for such a grand mansion.  Nearly all townhouses look across the street at another townhouse - not a park and the river like 3 Riverside Drive.



The exterior of the home is built in French Renaissance Revival style, rich with historical elements including carved limestone ornaments, gabled dormers, and a wide projected bay. It proudly and prominently sits between 72nd and 73rd Streets on Riverside Drive, located proximally to world class culture, restaurants, parks, and transportation.

Situated on the neighborhood's most desirable block, just steps from Central Park, 41 West 70th Street is the fifth in a series of eight beautiful single family homes. Originally designed by the architect Gilbert A. Schellinger in the Renaissance Revival style in 1891, the interior was completely demolished and and re-built into this modern classic.

This private residence was built by an architect with a focus on maintaining light and flow on each floor. It has been meticulously constructed, with similar materials to those chosen by Olmstead & Vaux in their construction of Central Park: blue stone, pigmented stucco, almond tinted mortar, steel casement windows, limestone, clinker & roman brick, copper flashing. The original 120 year old structural beams were planed and woven back into the architecture.

Prolific Upper West Side architect Charles T. Mott held nothing back when designing this five-story gem for one of the Dow Jones founders, Edward Jones. The townhouse facade embraces the glory of Renaissance Revival stylings by combining stone, Roman brick, arches, and columns. Even lion heads decorate the pressed-metal cornice. The interior doesnt shy away from grandeur either. Gut-renovated in, no detail was overlooked when transforming the townhouse back into a single-family mansion.

Beyond coats of fresh paint and no squeaks or leaks this twenty-footer is currently in turn-key condition. Inside, youll find six bedrooms, five full and three half-baths, elevator access on each floor, and outstanding entertaining spaces including a top-of-the-line kitchen and a private screening room. Expanding upon Motts original vision, the current owners realized the townhouse was uniquely positioned to take in views of the Hudson River, so two additional levels of outdoor living space were built on the roof.

Located steps from Riverside Park and close to neighborhood classics like Zabars, Fairway, Citarellas and The Beacon Theater, 325 West 76th Street is the gold standard of townhouse living inside and out.

Garden Floor:

The sheer scale and dramatic flair is a preview of things to come. From restored moldings and banisters to the artfully reproduced wainscoting, the foyer and parlour front are a wonderful balance of traditional details and modern finishes. The townhouse renovation included the creation of an open layout that combines the formal living and dining rooms into a contemporary great room. The focal point of this space remains the extraordinary original fireplace with decorative paneling over the mantel.

A pocket door at the back of the dining room opens to reveal a true chefs kitchen. The parlour rear hosts a stunning space suitable for competitive cooking or family-style dinners. Boasting custom cabinets and shelving, a large island with a rack for cookware above, double ovens, gas stove, spacious SubZero, and banquette seating overlooking the garden, this room makes the townhouse a home. A lovely powder room is conveniently located at rear of floor adjacent to stairs that lead down to a butlers pantry and the family room.

Third Floor:
The third floor accommodates two bedrooms with custom closets and gracious, ensuite bathrooms. The front bedroom boasts a huge bow window as well as a fireplace with a lovely, original mantelpiece and new blue-toned marble hearth. The rear bedroom is bright and airy as it has large windows that provide excellent views of the garden below. The laundry room is located on this floor.
