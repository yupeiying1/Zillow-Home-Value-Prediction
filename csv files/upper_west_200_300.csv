EMERY ROTH: THE ARCHITECT



""Emery Roth dominated the age of apartment buildings.""  Paul Goldberger, The New York Times

 

Arriving in New York at the age of 13, Emery Roth already spoke several languages, had graduated from high school and was an astounding draftsman.  He read prodigiously and possessed an incredible work ethic.   In 1893, he began two years as a draftsman for Richard Morris Hunt, the foremost architect of the day, working on prime buildings of the World's Columbian Exposition of Chicago: a celebration of Beaux-Arts architecture and American ingenuity in that all the buildings were white and sparkling at night with newly invented electric lights.  The Exposition architecture relied heavily on the classics for inspiration, a portico from one Roman temple, and dome from another, but these classical architectural elements were combined into something totally new.  The architects of the Exposition created an eclectic Beaux Arts Neoclassical style, of which Roth would become a principal exponent and acknowledged expert.  Ultimately, he would design over 200 classically ornamented buildings.

 

THE RENOVATION

A complete list of all finishes is available upon request.

 

This apartment is on the 14th floor, the highest level before the setback occurs which reduces the length of the interior rooms above this floor.  There are five rooms that offer Central Park Views:  Entrance gallery, the Living Room, Library, Master Bedroom and Master Bath. A gut renovation of the apartment was completed in May 2018 with the same devotion to detail that drove Emery Roth, restoring the past and incorporating every modern detail. Comprising 3 bedrooms and a library, with 3.5 incomparable baths, there is not a square inch that has not been artfully considered.

 

Renovation highlights include: 

 

*	Original building windows with original restored brass hardware, and new laminated glass with protective UV film on all Central Park-facing windows with motorized solar and blackout shades.

*	Woods include walnut, white oak and American black walnut

*	Six varieties of marble

*	Unique bathroom sinks and faucets

*	Split 3-zone HVAC

*	Numerous environmental design features

 

TODAY'S ARCHITECT: ALAN WANZENBERG

 

Also an expert in many styles, Wanzenberg is a student of all periods of architecture - from the Frank Lloyd Wright homes of his childhood to the Art Institute of Chicago Thorne Miniature rooms, a ""visual treasure of architectural history,"" he writes.  Among other degrees, he has a master's degree from the Harvard Graduate School of Design.  He worked at I.M. Pei and with Jed Johnson of Warhol fame. The concept of fine craftsmanship inspired Wanzenberg to champion early 20th Century Arts and Crafts furniture and his extreme attention to detail is apparent in every inch of this apartment.  He focuses his total attention on ""sense of place"" so that one feels what he has created has been there forever.  A perfect sensibility for this particular assignment.



All in all, this apartment is defined by an incomparable renovation sensitive to the building's architectural heritage, with an abundance of light to the east and west, exquisite panoramas of Central Park, and an ideal height within The Beresford, and is reminiscent of the building's extraordinary architect and the effortless elegance Emery Roth created nearly 90 years ago and Alan Wanzenberg reinterpreted for today's sensibility.

Located in the heart of the West 80s, this townhouse has six levels of living space and is an excellent balance of traditional features and modern amenities. Reconverted from a multi-family to a single-family townhouse in 2006, this home had undergone an additional extensive renovation in 2012 and 2013.


The upgrades include: renovations to the wine cellar and gym, new floors and cabinets in the cellar level, new mantels throughout, new kitchen downstairs, all bathrooms renovated, new wallpaper, reconversion of the master dressing room, new home office on the 4th floor, upgraded HVAC, and access to the terraces on two floors. 


Boasting soaring ceilings and light-filled rooms, this home is warm and welcoming. It features six working fireplaces, a top-of-the-line kitchen with Miele and Viking appliances, a grand master suite, home gym, and a 1,000 bottle wine cellar. There are also several outdoor spaces including private terraces on the third and fourth floors, a multi-level back deck off the parlour floor, and a rear garden with tidy paver stones and mature trees.
 

Due to the fact the owner insisted on custom renovations, the quality of materials and attention to detail is second to none. You'll never find this level care with a developer-renovated home.


Garden Level: 
A private, gated entrance under the stoop leads to a hospitable foyer with built-in seating and storage where one can transition out of the hustle and bustle of the city. The garden front room is flooded with light and features a fireplace. It can serve as a guest room or home office. Adjoining it is a galley style kitchen with full-size appliances and a lovely glass tile backsplash. The remaining two-thirds of the floor flows into an open family room with exposed brick, custom shelving, and glass doors that access the garden. There is also a renovated full bath on this floor. 


Parlour Level:
As you enter the parlour level, pass through double doors and the vestibule into a graceful entrance hall complete with original wainscoting, ornately carved mirror and bench, and a splendid staircase. Townhouse aficionados will appreciate the details and level of care that went into preserving much of the woodwork on this floor. Journey into the parlour front and behold soaring ceilings, an exquisite original hearth and mantelpiece, and stained glass transom windows. The formal dining room also maintains a sense of traditionalism with another fireplace and wide chair rail. More double doors lead to a sunlit eat-in kitchen at the rear of the floor. With clean lines, top-notch appliances, and a view into the garden below, this kitchen will bring joy to professional and amateur chefs alike. 


Third Floor:
The third floor contains a floor-through Master Suite. The well-appointed rear bedroom features an original fireplace and French doors that lead to a private terrace. The master bathroom is an oasis decked in modern amenities including floor to ceiling marble tile, a soaking jacuzzi tub, steam shower, and double vanity. A modern dressing area with his and hers closets, dedicated shoe storage, wet bar, and gorgeous original flooring connect the bedroom to the front sitting room. The front room boasts three large windows and another wonderful fireplace. 


Fourth Floor:
A sizeable sunny bedroom with original moldings and fireplace occupies the front of this floor. A full bath can be accessed from both the front bedroom and the hallway. The rear of the floor has a sleek home office with custom cabinetry and wall-paneling. There are also French doors that access another private rear terrace. An oversized walk-in linen closet completes the floor. 


Fifth Floor:
Ascend the stairs to the top floor and you'll find two more generous bedrooms. Each bedroom has ample closet space and gets amazing light from large windows and skylights. There is also a full bath, laundry room, and a centralized open area for a playroom or small den.
