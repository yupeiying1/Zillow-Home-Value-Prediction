Jean Nouvel's awe-inspiring design of 100 Eleventh Avenue, a far-west Chelsea condominium completed in 2009, has captured the imagination, and is monumentally ensconced in the New York skyline. The far-west site allowed Nouvel unhampered freedom to design an unprecedented structure that embodies spectacular views and light. The Pritzker award-winning architect has successfully created the interesting dichotomy between the vibrant, mosaic-like, asymmetric window facade of varied shapes and sizes with a calm, minimalist interior. 
The space of 16C, a high floor consisting of approx.2650sf with 3 bedrooms, and 3.5 baths, attests to Nouvel's singular achievement with South-West, East and North exposures. The sparse and clean design accentuated by the white terrazzo floors running throughout the unit, provides a gallery-like setting in which to accept the unpredictable placement of windows to its east and north with the surprise element of framed ""postcard photos"" of New York City's skyscrapers, including the Empire State Building and the Met Life Building. The south-west's continual floor-to-ceiling curtain of glass, measuring approximately 70', extends throughout the Great Room, and 2 of the 3 bedrooms including the master bedroom. Amazing south views encompass the Statue of Liberty, and the Hudson River to its west, providing a hypnotic appreciation of the ever-changing light and movement of shadow. 
The open and expansive plan of the Great room consists of Living Room, Dining and Kitchen. The loft-like space with high ceilings can easily accommodate individual life styles. The beauty of 16C is that Nouvel's design has not been tampered with; it exists in its original conception. The architect's hand is everywhere: from the cool stainless steel kitchen design with top appliances to the details of lighting and bathroom fixtures.
