In 1846 a row of four brick houses was built for a gentleman carpenter named Henry Ten Broeck likely in association with the architectural firm, Dunham & Williams. Mr. Broeck took one house for his own. 111 Bank Street was among this distinguished sequence of buildings. 111 Bank was always the multi-apartment house that it is today. Among its first occupants were a wigmaker, a hatter, a carpenter and a silversmith. Later in the early to mid-twentieth century Maximillian Schmeling resided there. Schmeling may not be a household name, but the German immigrant was famous in his day, having been the heavyweight boxing champion of the World between 1930 and 1932. He had two fights with the more-recognizable Joe Louis.  111 Bank Street, built in the Greek Revival Style, is landmarked because of its historical significance to the cobblestone block situated on the Western edge of the West Village. The windows have their distinctive projecting sills and lintels with small cornices. Inside, mantels adorn each of the six woodburning fireplaces. The configuration of the chimneys tells us that additional fireplaces could be added. Landmark approved updates include refurbishing the stoop and installing wood frame windows.  There are 5 simplex apartments and one triplex which has a backyard with an enviable 715 square feet.  At its center is a tall flowering dogwood. The potential for this outdoor space is limitless. It is so large that there is ample space for anything you might imagine: a garden, a tree swing, an outdoor entertaining space spun with lights and discreet heat lamps would allow for use in three seasons; your outdoor kitchen can be a simple gas grill or something more elaborate for the home chef who has dreamt of cooking underneath the canopy of the West Village sky. There are two additional outdoor spaces: a 220 square foot patio off the back of the house, and a 176 square foot terrace overlooking the backyard from its perch off the third floor. The rooftop offers yet another canvas for outdoor living.  The house will be delivered vacant. Houses in need of renovation are not unique; an opportunity to reconfigure a historical home that retains the architectural charms Mr. Broeck envisioned when he built his patch of Bank Street in 1846, is not one often seen."
