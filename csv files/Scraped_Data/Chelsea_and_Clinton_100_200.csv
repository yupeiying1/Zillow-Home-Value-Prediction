HISTORY 



Built in 1847 in Greek Revival style, the westernmost section of 11 - 13 West 10th Street was erected for Richard H. Winslow, a Wall Street financier, renowned for his role as the originator of the railroad bond system. The eastern half of the property remained vacant until 1888, when noted architect Ernest Flagg added an extension to the property. This portion of the home reached completion in 1919 when it was raised to align with the western segment, and joined with a single cornice.



From 1919 until the mid nineties, 11 - 13 West 10th Street was home to the Ladies Christian Union, and operated as a residence hall for young businesswomen. The property became known as the ""Milbank House,"" in recognition of Jeremiah Milbank, an investment banker, manufacturer and railroad investor, who significantly enlarged the home and donated it to the Ladies Christian Union in memory of his mother and wife, both of whom had served as presidents of the charity.



The New York University Law School purchased 11 - 13 West 10th Street from the Ladies Christian Union in 1994. It was used to house the Global Law School Program, which functioned as a base for visiting professors to lecture on campus. The home was later purchased by private owners, who created the magnificent single-family residence present today."

Located on a prime Gold Coast block in the landmarked neighborhood of Greenwich Village, a beautiful and historic home is now on the market. This Greek Revival townhouse was built in 1848 by Josiah Dodge, and the deed has only changed hands five times in 170 years. The faade was modified in the 1920s in the Italianate style, adding elegant ironwork and french doors, and giving the house a unique stature. Many of the architectural details are stunningly intact, making this home a valuable testament to not one but two genres of New York City townhouse architecture.

This 21.5' wide home features five bedrooms, three full baths, and one half bath. Situated mid-block on a quiet street, the home is a true sanctuary. The house sits on a 103' lot and includes an expansive 50-foot north-facing garden with large trees including a flowering magnolia and maple. Surrounded by other townhouse gardens, enjoy full privacy in the beautifully landscaped space, an outdoor oasis in the heart of the city. Complete with a gas line for a grill, the garden is perfect for relaxing, dining outdoors, and entertaining. 

The family room and kitchen are on the garden floor, with a wall of windows to the ceiling, filling the space with light and creating the feeling of indoor-outdoor living. Double glass doors lead to the garden. The renovated kitchen has a Sub Zero refrigerator, Miele dishwasher, Thermador 36"" gas range, Dacor electric convection oven, warming drawer, and microwave. There is also an entertainment area with a wine refrigerator and second sink. The ground floor has a separate gated entrance under the stoop.

The large stoop leads to an impressive entryway. Walk in and be wowed by the double parlor with 12-foot high ceilings, original moldings, columns, and pocket doors. The Venetian tearoom, most likely dating from the 1920s, has original arched mirrors, an arts and crafts tile floor, and a beautiful marble fountain on the east wall. Enclosed with glass, it is a truly special place to sit and enjoy the garden views. 

The master bedroom has french doors leading to Juliet balconies, flooding the space with southern light. The master suite floor includes a bath, home office, and den. Step out on the terrace into the treetops and you will feel like you have left the city! 

A vintage stained glass sky light illuminates the staircase leading to the top floor, which consists of a media room or kids' playroom, two bedrooms, bath, and large laundry room/home gym. One of the bedrooms has the bath en suite and a wrought iron balcony. 

Original details and charm prevail throughout this distinctive home. There are eight fireplaces, three of which are fully lined for wood burning, and one which is gas. William H Jackson appraised several of the mantels and determined that they installed them when the home was built. The mantels are rendered in gorgeous English and French marble, some with richly detailed inlays. In addition, there are beautiful oak parquet floors, a nod to the home's past era. Modern conveniences include central air conditioning controlled in four zones, a security system and up-to-date fiber optics. The townhouse is featured in Bricks and Brownstones, Charles Lockwood's book which chronicles the homes of Greenwich Village. A rare opportunity to own a piece of New York City history in a prime location, this townhouse is a truly unique and special place to call home. 

Our alternate floor plan reflects various possibilities to expand this home including a gym in the basement, two-story extension in the back, and a roof deck."

A private parking spot in the building is included.  This apartment was transformed into a stunning home by the renown Studio Shamshiri, who opened the apartment up and pared things down to create a clean, but warm and modern space.  This penthouse is among the largest and best in the entire building.  This home, which has one of the best laid floor plans, is a rare and very special offering that is up for sale for the first time.  It's a must-see for those with a rather discerning and elevated taste level.Inspiration for the home was pulled from British architect William Smalley, specifically seen in the wood paneling and baseboards. The millwork throughout was inspired by Shaker designs and the playroom was inspired by Inezand Vinoodh's Manhattan loft. Other references were pulled from contemporaries including Vincent Van Duysen, Plain English, and the Rivertown Lodge in upstate New York, designed by the firm Workstead.Design highlights include 16' Dinesen Douglas Fir flooring, 30' sofa by Commune for George Smith, the yellow kitchen with hand-painted BBDW tiles, lighting by Apparatus, and the custom Donald Judd inspired bookshelves.  The home is impeccable to the eye, yet very comfortable to live in.  There are many quiet details to enjoy from the custom Nanz hardware to the bespoke BDDW tiles in the kitchen.  There is plenty of custom millwork throughout starting with a very powerful wall-to-wall-statement in the entry foyer that acts as a modern day Manhattan mudroom. The home is delivered with in-wall speakers and a Lutron lighting system. The large eat-in and windowed kitchen would make a chef quite happy.  It comes complete with a 2.5"" end grain butcher block counter at the kitchen island.  The yellow painted, custom shaker style cabinets add a sense of warmth to the home. There are two dishwashers, a 48"" Wolfe range, a high speed in wall Wolfe oven and a subzero refrigerator.  The backsplash is a beautiful, hand-made BDDW tile.  Adjacent to the kitchen is a large walk-through pantry made of custom millwork.  The master suite has two walk-in-closets and an en-suite master bathroom, which is elegantly appointed with a custom millwork vanity with pale marble countertop, under-mounted soaking tub, glass enclosed shower, and marble mosaic floor.  In addition there is a large sitting area that rounds off the suite.Additional bedrooms feature large windows, en-suite bathrooms, and highly-crafted details, including custom millwork beds. Other features include a powder room, washer/dryer, and four-pipe HVAC system with multiple zoned climate controls for maximum year-round flexibility.In addition, the building offers a staggering array of state-of-the-art amenities never before available in the West Village, including a full fitness and wellness level with professionally designed facilities, yoga and treatment rooms, 25-meter swimming pool with hot tub, and high-end golf simulator; spacious residents' lounge, dining room with guest chef's kitchen and separate catering kitchen; a 21-seat screening room; a light-filled children's playroom; bicycle and private storage; and 24-hour attended lobbies. The Greenwich Lane is a collection of five unique addresses and five townhouses nestled together in the West Village, New York's most intimate and desirable neighborhood. Revitalizing nearly a full city block between Twelfth and Eleventh Streets off Seventh Avenue, the development is groundbreaking for its LEED-certified architecture by FXFOWLE, and for world-renowned designer Thomas O'Brien's visionary interiors and dramatic public spaces. A rare mix of historical restoration and innovative new construction, each building carries the grace of its own era: from stately pre-war elegance to modern contemporary sophistication. Every home represents handcrafted luxury, bridging the glamour of Old New York with the ease and individuality of modern living through airy, light- and view-filled residences. All surround a lush central garden, designed by M. Paul Friedberg & Partners, in the spirit of classic village greens."
