The spectacular penthouse residence at 498 WEA possesses a grandeur, both in scale and workmanship. Set atop a quintessential Upper West Side landmark constructed in 1910 by Neville & Bagge, this newly constructed full-floor duplex is a rare combination of prewar craft and contemporary artistry, perfect for entertaining as well as restorative time at home. Thoughtfully designed by CetraRuddy Architecture to accommodate a 21st century lifestyle, this uniquely exceptional home boasts spectacular finishes and grand proportions. The premium grade details that grace the interiors impart a pervasive sense of quality, and the curated design ushers in a new vernacular - where space and light mix with elevated materials to infuse traditional forms with inventiveness.

 The keyed elevator service to this topmost unit opens up into a warm and inviting foyer. Upon entering the penthouse, the new oversized windows welcome an abundance of light from all directions, keeping the home bright and airy. The solid white oak floors in a custom 30-inch square rift-and-quartered parquet inspired pattern, accentuate the dining and living rooms. An expansive wrap-around terrace, at its longest spanning close to 90 feet, makes for a covetable outdoor space ideal for lounging as well as hosting cocktails and dinner fetes against the backdrop of an exquisite panorama of the Hudson River. Designed to deliver equal portions of elegance and functionality, every facet of the kitchen exceeds the highest standards while also delivering innovative design concepts - from the outstanding millwork in custom chocolate-stained oak with contrasting cream-colored ceruse, to a single-slab marble hearth wall that conceals the range hood. Outfitted for the most seasoned cooks, the kitchen also showcases Calacatta countertops, Miele appliances, a 48-inch Bertazzoni gas range, and a Gaggenau warming drawer and wine refrigerator. The five spacious bedrooms are a study in proportion and light. The windowed master en-suite bathroom, with its winsome richness of detail, contains a large walk-in glass shower, deep soaking tub with marble surround, mosaic marble floors and custom fluted glasswork, and shagreen textured double sink vanity. The secondary bath presents a marble mosaic floor, custom designed white lacquer vanity with polished nickel ring pulls and a nickel-framed custom medicine cabinet. In contrast, the dramatic powder room is finished with Herringbone-patterned dark spider polished marble floors and custom black lacquer vanity with mirror-facing drawers and brass oriental pulls. 

The stately 24-hour attended lobby has been tastefully reworked to feature decorative wall panels in a geometric pattern, and walls and flooring in a composition of marbles. Additional conveniences include a fitness room, children's playroom, secured storage, and bicycle storage. From the broad leafy streets of the corner it occupies, to its proximity to Riverside Park and bustling Upper West Side venues, 498 West End Avenue is nestled in the heart of one of New York's most desirable neighborhoods. The bones of this beautiful turn-of-the-20th century building and its ageless edifice provided the ideal envelope for CetraRuddy's new addition to the building's architectural heritage. This Penthouse residence is a standout amongst its competitors, elevating it to a timeless sophistication satisfying the needs of the most discerning buyer.
