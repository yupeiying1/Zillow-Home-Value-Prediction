This spectacular townhouse is arguably the most beautiful and single-family residence in Harlem. Once restored, it will be the largest and most significant one-family home in all of Upper Manhattan. Luxuriate in the stunning dimensions and well-preserved details of this magnificent home, one of a row of seven designed in the late 19th Century by William B. Tuthill, the visionary architect of Carnegie Hall. 

This central Harlem townhouse has a prestigious history of ownership, including a Trinidadian native who became one of the first black homeowners in Manhattan. Situated on a lovely tree-lined block still largely defined by Tuthill's inimitable architectural style, it is a combination of elegant flourishes, impeccable quality and real-world function. 

Behold the impressive rock-faced facade, with interlacing arabesque panels, which stand out against alternating stretches of smooth surfaces. This exceptional, unusual 25-foot-wide townhouse also offers four bathrooms, along with a very desirable and space-efficient central staircase, extending under natural light that shines through a skylight and reaches the garden level. 

The Garden Level 
Enter this resplendent single-family residence on the garden level and admire the exterior and interior original mahogany doors and molding. A generous front living room, featuring rounded Tiffany-style stained-glass windows and a gorgeously distinguished fireplace, leads into home office space, and a sprawling eat-in-kitchen at the rear. The kitchen and an adjacent garden room overlook a delightful south-facing backyard, which offers substantial patio space and ample shade. The enormous, sunny-all-day south-facing garden has a beautiful church to its east, and to the west, another of the block's sophisticated residences with an open garden. 

The Parlor Level 
The Parlor level will immediately transport you to a time long forgotten. With soaring 12-foot ceilings, you will discover breathtaking details rarely remaining in townhouses of this era. Upon entering the parlor level from the top of the stoop, everything is original from 1889: the double mahogany glass doors; the rich, handcrafted woodwork; and a magnificent floor-to-ceiling mirror and bench. The original full-height pocket doors open to reveal a front parlor, an anteroom, and the dining room at the rear. Lean in closer and let the commanding details take your breath away: an enormous fireplace arrangement with columned pavilions supporting a gabled canopy of arcaded brackets, a cast plaster frieze of garlands and cherubs, wainscoting, and -- perhaps the crowning touch among these richly textured features - Tiffany-style stained-glass windows, including a depiction of one of Greek mythologys most enduring heroines, Penelope, in the dining room overlooking the garden. 

The Third & Fourth Floors
 Gaze up at the soaring ceilings on these levels too, where youll discover bedrooms outfitted with dressing and living areas - space that could easily be customized to fit your familys specific needs. The rooms are also well-appointed with an assortment of exquisite details - bay windows, moldings, fireplaces - that make this entire home such a standout jewel among Harlem's most wonderful treasures. 

The Neighborhood & Beyond 
Scenic locales, including Marcus Garvey Park and Central Park, world-class culture and delicious eats are all within walking distance, with easy access to public transit - subways and buses for navigating New York City -- and highway entrances for private transportation to all points beyond."
