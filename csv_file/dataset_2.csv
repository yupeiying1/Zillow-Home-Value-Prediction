If you've never been to the historic Piano Factory, you owe it to yourself to come see this enchanting place. Circa 1874, it features some of the most unique lofts in Manhattan. This loft, located on the top floor, is a spacious 3 bedroom plus sleep loft, 3 full bath loft and features ceilings that approach 14 feet. Nine tall windows run its 52 feet of south facing frontage, providing great light and open city views in every room, something rarely found in lofts. THE LOFT:Arguably the most coveted loft in the Piano Factory, the sponsor kept this unit for himself for years after the loft conversion before selling it. It was subsequently designed and renovated by the two principals of Rietveld Architects, who brought it to its current Architectural Digest level.An entry foyer leads to the living/dining area, nearly 20 feet wide and nearly 36 feet in length. The ceiling rises from 12 1/2 feet in the dining area to nearly 14 feet at the windowed wall. The open and spacious chef's kitchen will impress the most discerning cook. It features: a 48"" Thermador range with a double oven, 4 burners, a charcoal grill and a griddle; a Thermador hood that vents to the outside; an oversized Sub-Zero frig; a Bosche dishwasher; a double sink and ample granite counter prep space that extends into an eating bar that seats 4.The dining area can easily fit a table to seat up to 12 people.

Lastly, it features a 20SF private storage unit with access from the building hallway. THE BUILDING:Dating back to the late 1800s, The Piano Factory building is a loft-conversion on the site of the former Wessell, Nickel & Gross Company, a piano works and soundboard factory. Today, the building is a well-established, self-managed co-op with very low monthlies, allowing pets, pied-ÌÊ-terres and subletting. And yes, even pianos! At the entry, a Romanesque Revival archway leads you to the building's iconic European style landscaped courtyard, at once leafy yet beautifully industrial. Originally serving as the factory's storage yard, today the brick-lined outdoor spaces are punctuated by striking original steel catwalks and inviting seating areas. The Piano Factory has frequently been used for movie and television filming because of its photogenic beauty.THE NEIGHBORHOOD:Located in the heart of vibrant Hell's Kitchen, this home is at the center of quintessential New York living, just 2 blocks from the Theater District and the heart of Midtown.

If you've never been to the historic Piano Factory, you owe it to yourself to come see this enchanting place. Circa 1874, it features some of the most unique lofts in Manhattan. This loft, located on the top floor, is a spacious 2 bedroom plus sleep loft, 2 full bath loft and features ceilings that approach 14 feet. Seven tall windows run its 43 feet of south facing frontage, providing great light and open city views in every room, something rarely found in lofts. THE LOFT:Arguably the most coveted loft in the Piano Factory, the sponsor kept this unit for himself for years after the loft conversion before selling it. It was subsequently designed and renovated by the two principals of Rietveld Architects, who brought it to its current Architectural Digest level.An entry foyer leads to the living/dining area, nearly 20 feet wide and nearly 36 feet in length. The ceiling rises from 12 1/2 feet in the dining area and to nearly 14 feet at the windowed wall. The open and spacious chef's kitchen will impress the most discerning cook. It features: a 48"" Thermador range with a double oven, 4 burners, a charcoal grill and a griddle; a Thermador hood that vents to the outside; an oversized Sub-Zero frig; a Bosche dishwasher; a double sink and ample granite counter prep space that extends into an eating bar that seats 4.The dining area can easily fit a table to seat up to 12 people. The living area features custom built-in bookshelves and easily accommodates several large pieces of furniture for ample seating, yet still provides ample room for either additional seating or mix & mingle room for large gatherings. Off the living area is the hallway leading to the bedrooms. The first bedroom features tall ceilings, plentiful closets and two tall windows. A full marble bath with a shower off the entry foyer serves this first bedroom.At the end of the hallway is the entrance to the master bedroom suite. This room features ceiling heights that approach 14 feet, two tall windows and a en-suite marble bath. A laundry area with a full-sized washer and dryer and storage is also located outside of the master en-suite bathroom.This loft also has an attic loft space of nearly 140 SF and height of 3 feet with a pull-down stairway, and an additional 10SF of storage in the sleep loft area.  THE BUILDING:Dating back to the late 1800s, The Piano Factory building is a loft-conversion on the site of the former Wessell, Nickel & Gross Company, a piano works and soundboard factory. Today, the building is a well-established, self-managed co-op with very low monthlies, allowing pets, pied-ÌÊ-terres and subletting. And yes, even pianos! At the entry, a Romanesque Revival archway leads you to the building's iconic European style landscaped courtyard, at once leafy yet beautifully industrial. Originally serving as the factory's storage yard, today the brick-lined outdoor spaces are punctuated by striking original steel catwalks and inviting seating areas. The Piano Factory has frequently been used for movie and television filming because of its photogenic beauty.THE NEIGHBORHOOD:Located in the heart of vibrant Hell's Kitchen, this home is at the center of quintessential New York living, just 2 blocks from the Theater District and the heart of Midtown. The amazing Hudson Yards and Brookfield Manhattan West developments to the south, and the Time Warner shops and Whole Foods to the north provide premier shopping, dining and entertainment, while the High Line, the Hudson River Greenway and nearby Central Park provide glorious outdoor Park space.

Shortly after, in the year 2010, famous interior designer Bjorn Bjornsson polished the entire home to timeless perfection. Also, all wiring, plasterwork, and flooring were redone to be high-performance and long-lasting. Once you step into the apartment you are greeted with a welcoming entrance gallery, gleaming hardwood floors, and high ceilings. Oversized windows in every room allow plenty of natural light to enter making it feel warm and welcoming from the very beginning. Custom items such as designer paintwork, blinds, shutters and lighting for the art throughout the entire home are an elegant addition to the residence. After you walk through the gallery, you enter a spacious living room graced with a functioning wood burning fireplace that invites comfort and exudes modern elegance making it perfect to relax or entertain. The living space is accompanied by a generous dining room that seats up to ten guests. Kitchen has stainless steel appliances with plentiful storage that will inspire both resident and guest.The grand master suite presents decorative mirrored walls, a walk-in closet/dressing room, and an opulent ensuite limestone bath.  The second bedroom, currently used as a library with custom lit built-in bookcases, and the third bedroom share a similarly opulent limestone bath with a custom Macassar Ebony vanity.Built in 1929, living in this classic 14 story prewar condominium is highly sought after, yet a rarity. Impressively, this intimate full-service building has only 45 units, a 24-hour doorman, attended elevator and live-in super. In addition, the lobby features an impressive limestone base and vaulted marble lobby.Once inhabited by only the most affluent, high-profile residents, Sutton Place is now a changing neighborhood.

The Paul Rudolph Townhouse at 23 Beekman Place presents a rare trifecta of iconic design, breathtaking views and a coveted address. Originally built in 1867 as a single family home in a row of elegant townhouses, the townhouse was purchased by the architect Paul Rudolph in 1976. Widely regarded as one of the most influential architects of the 20th Century, Rudolph was Chair of Yale University's School of Architecture in the 1960's. Through commissions such as the designer Halston's townhouse on East 63rd Street, Rudolph Hall at Yale University and numerous large scale projects both in the U.S. and abroad, Rudolph was a leading proponent of the Modernist movement. Soon after acquiring 23 Beekman Place, Rudolph embarked on a multi-year renovation of the five original floors of the townhouse and added a spectacular four-level penthouse. The penthouse became Rudolph's primary residence and ""design laboratory""; it is one of the most extraordinary residences in New York City and represents the culmination of Rudolph's thinking about architecture and interior design. With its 4 levels and 5 private terraces, the penthouse literally cantilevers over Beekman Place, affording breathtaking river views. There are 3 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms, a wood-burning fireplace and a chef's kitchen including a Gaggenau six burner stove, a Bosch dishwasher and two Subzero refrigerators. The current owners retained the architects Jared Della Valle and Andrew Bernheimer to update the penthouse in a manner consistent with Rudolph's vision, an effort which was awarded by the prestigious American Institute of Architecture.The five floors beneath the penthouse, which are accessed via elevator, are comprised of 3 private residences, each of which retains the hallmarks of Rudolph's signature style. The ground floor apartment is a duplex comprised of 2 bedrooms and 2 1/2 bathrooms and boasting a garden. The two apartments above this are also duplexes, each comprised of 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms and featuring full height windows with terraces looking onto the East River. The Paul Rudolph Townhouse presents several attractive possibilities: maintaining the current 4 residence configuration, living in the penthouse and keeping the lower floors as separate apartments or converting the entire building to a magnificent and uniquely iconic single family residence.",40.753398,-73.9645,https://www.zillow.com:443/homedetails/23-Beekman-Pl-New-York-NY-10022/2105496552_zpid/,18500000.0,0.0,1.0,11000,1930,10022.0
