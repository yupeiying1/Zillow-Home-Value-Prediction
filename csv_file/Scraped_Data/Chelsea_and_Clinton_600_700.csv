Nearly 38 ft. wide totaling approximately 12,100 sq. ft. (9,800 sq. ft. above grade), this mansion was originally built by architect John G. Prague between as two four-story buildings that have since been combined. Around 1928 its original Italianate faade was redesigned to its current, modern, uniform front for famed artist, Lucian Hamilton Tyng. Today's Landmarked faade includes a large rectangular studio on the fourth floor of what was 134 as well as a large segmental-arched window on the second floor of what was 136. There is an oriel and three small octagonal openings for what is now a staff suite/third bedroom on the fourth floor located towards the eastern front side of the building.


TODAY'S MODERN CLASSIC

The story begins with the main gallery. Stone floors-grand, formidable ? Or wood-warm and welcoming. No matter. The winding, elliptical staircase that greets you leaves the same winsome impression of grace and elegance.

Gather around the commodious kitchen: light gray, Christopher Peacock cabinetry accentuates the golden earth stones ingrained in the glorious white marble countertop and backsplash. The front sitting room is perfect for casual conversation and for sneaking quick bites from the kitchen while the garden, unviewable to neighbors, affords complete privacy for relaxation.

The entertaining floor is a show-stopper with its double-width great room, soaring double height ceilings, double height windows, and wood burning fireplace. The adjacent dining room has a wood burning fireplace, too, as well as Juliet balconies overlooking the garden. 

The guest suite on the next floor include a bedroom, study and its own mezzanine salon overlooking the great room below. 

Contributing to the glamour is the master floor above with two master dressing areas outfitted with Christopher Peacock cabinetry, two full baths en-suite--each with beautiful bay windows. Plus a terrace and two balconies overlook the garden. But the highlight here is the awe inspiring double height library with double height windows and a wood burning fireplace.

Four additional bedrooms, a staff suite, a recreation room and two terraces comprise the two upper floors. In the cellar is space for staff office, gym, steam room, full bathroom, wine cellar, and storage.

Delivered ""as is,"" much of the work in this new construction has already been completed.

One of the first modernist townhouses in Manhattan, this iconic property is rich with history, sophistication and postmodern elegance. Sherman M. Fairchild, a noted inventor and businessman, hired the architects William Hamby and George Nelson to create a home as adventurous as he was. They succeeded and the townhouse remains an architectural tour de force unlike any other in New York. 

The building's red granite faade was completed in 1981 and hints at the wonders inside. The 9,440 square-foot, 25 foot wide mansion is defined by a three-story great room, with a span of travertine walls illuminated from a glass and steel skylight. A zigzagging system of ramps facilitates the movement through the light-filled home. The result is an airy alternative to a traditional townhouse and the perfect setting for a world-class art collection.

The home includes a chef's kitchen, formal dining room, 5 bedrooms, 6 full bathrooms, 2 half bathrooms and a study/library worthy of The Frick. The master suite features two full bathrooms, floor to ceiling windows and a balcony overlooking 65th Street. An office, wine cellar, four additional bedrooms one with a loft aerie infused with natural light complete this one of a kind offering.

The townhouse is located on the Upper East Side, between Fifth and Madison Avenues with Central Park and Museum Mile at the doorstep."

The Paul Rudolph Townhouse at 23 Beekman Place presents a rare trifecta of iconic design, breathtaking views and a coveted address. Originally built in 1867 as a single family home in a row of elegant townhouses, the townhouse was purchased by the architect Paul Rudolph in 1976. Widely regarded as one of the most influential architects of the 20th Century, Rudolph was Chair of Yale University's School of Architecture in the 1960's. Through commissions such as the designer Halston's townhouse on East 63rd Street, Rudolph Hall at Yale University and numerous large scale projects both in the U.S. and abroad, Rudolph was a leading proponent of the Modernist movement. Soon after acquiring 23 Beekman Place, Rudolph embarked on a multi-year renovation of the five original floors of the townhouse and added a spectacular four-level penthouse. The penthouse became Rudolph's primary residence and ""design laboratory""; it is one of the most extraordinary residences in New York City and represents the culmination of Rudolph's thinking about architecture and interior design. With its 4 levels and 5 private terraces, the penthouse literally cantilevers over Beekman Place, affording breathtaking river views. There are 3 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms, a wood-burning fireplace and a chef's kitchen including a Gaggenau six burner stove, a Bosch dishwasher and two Subzero refrigerators. The current owners retained the architects Jared Della Valle and Andrew Bernheimer to update the penthouse in a manner consistent with Rudolph's vision, an effort which was awarded by the prestigious American Institute of Architecture.

The five floors beneath the penthouse, which are accessed via elevator, are comprised of 3 private residences, each of which retains the hallmarks of Rudolph's signature style. The ground floor apartment is a duplex comprised of 2 bedrooms and 2 1/2 bathrooms and boasting a garden. The two apartments above this are also duplexes, each comprised of 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms and featuring full height windows with terraces looking onto the East River. 

The Paul Rudolph Townhouse presents several attractive possibilities: maintaining the current 4 residence configuration, living in the penthouse and keeping the lower floors as separate apartments or converting the entire building to a magnificent and uniquely iconic single family residence."

The opportunity of a lifetime has presented itself to combine two apartments at the historic Piano Factory to create one of the most unique and one-of-a-kind trophy duplex penthouse apartments in all of Manhattan. The combined duplex penthouse would approximate 3,300 square feet of interior space with a massive private terrace in excess of 3,300 square feet that currently has protected and unobstructed views of Midtown Manhattan due to its coveted location in the heart of the Clinton Special District.   



PH7AS, which is currently on the market, is already one of the most unique and private penthouses in all of Manhattan with 2 bedrooms and 2 full bathrooms and one of the largest private terraces in all of Manhattan; approximately 3,300 square feet in size with the most spectacular and breathtaking views of the Midtown skyline. 



Apt 6ES, located directly below PH7AS, has just come on the market. Apt 6ES is a spacious 2 bedroom, 2 full bath loft exquisitely designed and renovated by the two principals of Rietveld Architects, who brought it to its current Architectural Digest level. It currently features a dramatic and spacious living dining area measuring nearly 20 feet wide and nearly 36 feet in length with high ceilings that rise from 12 ½ feet to nearly 14 feet at their highest point. 



Adjacent to the living/dining area of Apt 6ES is a spacious professional-level chef's kitchen that opens to the living/dining area and would impress the most discerning cook and entertainer. It features: a 48"" Thermador range with a double oven, 4 burners, a charcoal grill and a griddle; a Thermador hood that vents to the outside; an oversized Sub-Zero frig; a Bosche dishwasher; a double sink and ample granite counter preparation space that extends into an eating bar that comfortably seats 4.



There would be a myriad of possibilities for this duplexed unit, but at the very least, these two units would readily create a 4 bedroom/4 full bath duplex penthouse with substantial interior living and entertainment space, as well as over 3,300 square feet of private terrace for outdoor living and entertainment.



Bring your architect and your imagination to make this the trophy penthouse of your dreams!  



THE BUILDING:

Dating back to the late 1800s, The Piano Factory building is a loft-conversion on the site of the former Wessell, Nickel & Gross Company, a piano works and soundboard factory. Today, the building is a well-established, self-managed co-op with very low monthlies, allowing pets, pied-à-terres and subletting. At the entry, a Romanesque Revival archway leads you to the building's iconic European style landscaped courtyard, at once leafy yet beautifully industrial. Originally serving as the factory's storage yard, today the brick-lined outdoor spaces are punctuated by striking original steel catwalks and inviting leafy seating areas. The Piano Factory complex has frequently been used for movie and television filming because of its photogenic beauty.



THE NEIGHBORHOOD:

Located in the heart of vibrant Hell's Kitchen, this home is at the center of quintessential New York living, just 2 blocks from the Theater District and the heart of Midtown. The amazing Hudson Yards and Brookfield Manhattan West developments to the south, and the Time Warner shops and Whole Foods to the north provide premier shopping, dining and entertainment, while the High Line, the Hudson River Greenway and nearby Central Park provide glorious outdoor Park space. The eclectic restaurant scene of 9th Avenue is just around the corner and legendary Restaurant Row is a block away.
