Nestled in midst of the hustle and flow of Manhattan, this amazing new one bedroom with a huge private garden is an exciting new possibility for a fortunate buyer. This grand one bedroom, with a verdant oasis of an outdoor garden patio, is both a perfect daily respite and a wonderful place to host dinner parties with friends. Housed in a full-time doorman Pre-War building realized by two legends, the architect Emory Roth and builders Bing and Bing. This apartment was designed with Roth's trademarks - a generosity of space and wonderful functionality. The Venetian-plastered entry hall creates drama as it leads a visitor to the expansive and deep living room, eventually leading to the garden. Original oak floors and period details, like the decorative fireplace and glass-encased shelves, give the room a certain dignity, a grandeur. The wide bedroom swallows a king size bed and asks for more, please, and has one of this home's three walk in closets. The windowed en suite bathroom was renovated with deluxe Waterworks fixtures, a Zuma tub and a lovely large basket weave floor tile. With a home chef and dinner parties in mind, the kitchen was fitted with a six burner Viking Professional stove and range hood, double drawer Fisher Paykel dishwasher, marble countertops, a Waterworks faucet, and a Sub-Zero fridge and separate wine cooler. There is a second door to the garden for easy access to the charcoal barbecue. The South-facing L-shaped private garden, at approximately 875 sq ft, is truly something to experience. There are roses, hydrangeas, yews, ivy, concord grapes and a crepe myrtle that flowers prettily all summer. An automatic watering system is in place to keep it all looking lush. As seen from the garden, the gilded summit of the New York Life building shines golden like a second sun. An outdoor dining table for 6 looks almost miniature, leaving room for multiple Adirondack chairs and chaise longues. A short distance away is the iconic Flatiron building and Madison Square Park, which is home to Eataly, a great dog run, and public art exhibits. The restaurants in the area are unrivaled - from Danny Meyer's Blue Smoke Flatiron, where you can also catch top-tier music at the Jazz Standard, to the renowned Eleven Madison Park and a plethora of other culinary experiences. This pet-friendly building has a beautiful roof deck, laundry room, storage space (wait list), bike room (wait list) and a live-in Super. Pieds-a-terre and guarantors are allowed with board approval."
