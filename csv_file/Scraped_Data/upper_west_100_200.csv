It is often said that the kitchen is the heart of the home. It's where kids sprawl their homework on the table, where pets bob and weave around the busy humans, and where everyone gathers for meals. It's rare to find a home in New York City that features the kitchen as its centerpiece. But this is exactly what you'll find in apartment 4FG. 

 This one of a kind kitchen is larger than most living rooms in NYC! Its focus is a large La Cornue Fe double oven with five burners and a convenient pot-filler faucet, as well as the gorgeous hammered copper apron sink set next to the dishwasher. Enjoy meals from the custom banquette with seating for up to 10 people, or more casual dining at the breakfast bar with seating for 4. 

 The owners spent years meticulously renovating this home to maintain the pre-war charm while adding modern conveniences like custom closets, new electrical wiring, ethernet and speakers throughout, Bosch washer/dryer laundry concealed within a linen closet, and even a spa-like master bathroom with an 8-head shower. 

 The flexible layout of this combined apartment leaves plenty of options for reconfiguring to fit your needs. It is a true 3 bedroom, but currently used as two bedrooms with a den and an office off of the master bedroom. All above-sized bedrooms offer customized storage and en-suite bathrooms.
