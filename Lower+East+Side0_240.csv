Over the centuries, Manhattan has evolved to accommodate tremendous density - scale has shrunk, ceilings fallen, and grandeur diminished.  Still, hidden within the bustle, remain a few gems of graciousness - spaces of volume and splendor that, despite their throwback elegance, are simultaneously modern and crisp.  The Second Floor at 259 Bowery is one of those gems.



In the heart of Nolita, mere steps from the subway, Whole Foods, and the best galleries and eateries Downtown has to offer, sits this turn-of-the-century loft. The requisite features of the loft - the soaring ceiling height, expansive dimensions, oversized windows, exposed brick, and private keyed-elevator access - are all present, but the home offers much more.  For those features are merely the underlying bones to an astonishing renovation that's been overlaid upon them.



Meticulously crafted millwork runs throughout the nearly 100 linear feet from front to back.  The craftsmanship creates a one-of-a-kind aesthetic that's profound and felt in every corner from the arched wooden canopy in the nearly-square living/dining space in the front of the apartment, to the ingenious kitchen storage solutions and media center in the trunk of the loft, to the copious and cavernous closet space in the bedroom wing in the back.  Punctuating the aesthetic are all of the highest-end materials and serene comforts one would expect:  Viking and Subzero appliances, a Poggen Phol build-out, integrated lighting and media systems, two spa-quality bathrooms, a fireplace for cool winter nights, and a deep outdoor space for summer cocktails.  Come and see for yourself."
